# MS&E 246-Final Project

## 1. Introduction

In order to better understand the factors that affect loan charge-off rate and its
potential influence on investors, we design and implement a model of small-business
loan charge-off based on a data set of roughly 150,000 equipment loans backed by the
US Small Business Administration between 1990 and 2014.
